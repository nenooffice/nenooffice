Hi! Sorry for the drama. You can call me Neno, and I am a Dev in formation (as I will ever be.). Actually, you can see the languages I programming in the moment on the bottom of the screen, as my social media, and under this lil' hello you can see my lastest projects. So, take your time and have fun, or anything else that you wanna have seeing a profile like mine. (And yeah, I know that's "No One is Here is grammatically wrong, but who knows? Maybe something more it's behind this...)
